HyperNEAT and evolutionary computation are utilized in an attempt to evolve
interesting distortions to images of faces that are applicable despite any
projective transformation due to the camera or pose and applicable to faces in
general despite differences in dimensions, proportions, shade, etc. between
individuals.
